# Week 8 Discussion Topics

## Topics

### Option 1

How is an interactive query tool different than a traditional relational database? How are they similar? 

### Option 2

How do interactive query tools relate to the Lambda architecture? How do these tools relate to data warehouses and data lakes? 

### Option 3

Most interactive query tools use SQL as a query language. Does every query tool support the same SQL statements? How do different implementations support user-defined functions? Provide specific examples. 

### Option 4

The original implementation of Apache Hive translated queries into MapReduce batch jobs. This usually meant long wait times while waiting for the job to complete.  How are modern query tools able to query large amounts of data without the long wait times associated with earlier query tools? 

### Option 5

Tools like Spark SQL and Hive support querying data stored in multiple formats and locations. Compare and contrast different data formats and storage locations with a focus on use cases for each. 

### Option 6

Who are the typical users of interactive query tools? What are the common use cases? When would you use an interactive query tool over creating a batch or streaming program? When would you create custom code instead of using an interactive query tool?
