# Week 9 Discussion Topics

## Topics

### Option 1

What are some of the machine learning frameworks available for Python and R? Which frameworks enable training models using a cluster of computers? In your opinion, which features are most important when evaluating a machine learning framework? 

### Option 2

The k-means clustering algorithm requires choosing the number of clusters (i.e. the value for *k*) before training the model. How do you determine the optimal value for *k*? 

### Option 3

In the movie *Marvel's The Avengers*, the team is looking for the Tesseract using its gamma radiation emissions.  Bruce Banner, a scientist with expertise in the field of gamma radiation says: 

> Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. 

Explain in detail the steps necessary to implement Dr. Banner's approach. What kind of data sources and algorithms would you use? How would you identify a source of concentrated gamma radiation? 

### Option 4

Clustering and recommendation algorithms are examples of unsupervised learning algorithms. What is the difference between a supervised and unsupervised learning algorithm? Are there ways to use unsupervised learning algorithms to augment supervised learning algorithms?  

### Option 5

What are examples of clustering algorithms other than k-means? 

### Option 6

What methods are available for evaluating the performance of a clustering algorithm? 

### Option 7

How would you use a clustering algorithm on non-numeric data (e.g. text)? 

### Option 8

What algorithms can you use to create a recommendation system? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type of algorithm?
