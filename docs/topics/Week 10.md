# Week 10 Discussion Topics

## Topics

### Option 1

What is the difference between a linear and non-linear model? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type of model? 

### Option 2

What are the ideal use cases for deep learning models? What are the limitations of deep learning models? 

### Option 3

Which performance metrics can you use to evaluate a binary classification model? Are there circumstances in which you should choose one metric over another? 

### Option 4

Why would you use regularization used in a logistic regression model? What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? Why would you choose one method over the other? 

### Option 5

Why should you split your data into training and testing sets? What is the purpose of a training set and what is the purpose of a testing set? 

### Option 6

What is a tensor and what is its relationship to deep learning? How does the choice of hardware (e.g. CPU vs GPU) impact the performance of processing tensor-based workflows? 

### Option 7

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a language prediction model created by OpenAI. How large is the GPT-3 model? What are some interesting applications of the GPT-3 model? Are there any ethical considerations that arise from the use of GPT-3?
